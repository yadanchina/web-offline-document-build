                    li If it's a bug report or how-to question, make sure the author has provided a minimum online demo with either <a href="https://codepen.io/Ovilia/pen/dyYWXWM" target="_blank">Codepen</a> to show what's going wrong.

                h3 Documents
                p Documentation is massively important to help users make the most of Apache ECharts and it's probably the area that needs the most help! So if you are interested, whether it's just to fix a page here or there, correct a link or improve what documentation is already there, please do dive in and help!
                p The source code of document is available at <a href="https://github.com/apache/echarts-doc" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and maybe the easiest way to find where to change is by searching key words already there.
                p In the issue list, we also have a <a href="https://github.com/apache/echarts/labels/doc" target="_blank">"doc"</a> label. We appreciate pull requests to fix them indeed!


                h2 Becoming a Committer or PMC Member!
                p As we mentioned above, we appreciate the help for ECharts in any forms. When we find someone making continuous contributions in the community, we will invite him/her to be our committer or PMC member.
                p Being a committer means you have the "write" access to the ECharts project, which enables you to contribute more easily and efficiently.
                p The Project Management Committee (PMC) is a committee charged with responsibility and governance of ECharts, whose members are directly responsible for overseeing releases and the healthy development of the community. More information can be found at <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html">Project Management Committee</a>.
                p We don't have a fixed single standard for selecting a committer or PMC member because we value all kinds of help offered. Generally, current PMC members watch the continuous contributors in the community and start discussion and votes for the candidates, and invite him/her to be a committer or PMC member after the vote passes.
