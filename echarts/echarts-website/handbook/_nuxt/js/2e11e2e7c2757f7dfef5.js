It is a form of a quasi-materialized display. It displays the data similar to the reading on a speedometer. The color of the gauger chart can be used to separate different categories of data.

The gauger chart is suitable for displaying single progress or measurement standard under quantitative conditions while it is not suitable for carpeting different variables or trends.\r\n\r\n2. You can provide info in different dimensions. However, do not include more than 3 pointers in one dashboard. It is recommended to use multiple dashboards if there are indeed multiple data to be displayed.\r\n\r\n<iframe max-width="830" width="100%" height="400"\r\nsrc="https://gallery.echartsjs.com/view-lite.html?cid=gauge-car">\r\n</iframe>\r\n'}}]);
