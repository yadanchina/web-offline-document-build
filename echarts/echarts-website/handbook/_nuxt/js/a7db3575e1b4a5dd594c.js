Compared with the normal line chart, the step line chart significantly shows the sudden changes of analyzed data.\r\n\r\nIn ECharts, `step` is used to characterize the connection type of the step line chart. It has three available values: `'start'`, `'end'`, and `'middle'`. For item A and B, these values corresponded that the corner occurred at A, B, and mid-point between A and B.\r\n\r\n```js live\r\noption = {\r\n  legend: {},\r\n  xAxis: {\r\n    type: 'category',\r\n    data: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']\r\n  },\r\n  yAxis: {\r\n    type: 'value'\r\n  },\r\n  series: [\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'Step Start',\r\n      type: 'line',\r\n      step: 'start',\r\n      data: [120, 132, 101, 134, 90, 230, 210]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'Step Middle',\r\n      type: 'line',\r\n      step: 'middle',\r\n      data: [220, 282, 201, 234, 290, 430, 410]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'Step End',\r\n      type: 'line',\r\n      step: 'end',\r\n      data: [450, 432, 401, 454, 590, 530, 510]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Please focus on the difference of line between three separate types.\r\n"}}]);
