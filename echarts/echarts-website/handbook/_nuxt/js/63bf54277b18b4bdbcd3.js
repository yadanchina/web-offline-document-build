Compared with the normal line chart, the area chart has more intuitive visual effects. It is especially suitable for the scenario with a few series.\r\n\r\n```js live\r\noption = {\r\n  xAxis: {\r\n    data: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']\r\n  },\r\n  yAxis: {},\r\n  series: [\r\n    {\r\n      data: [10, 22, 28, 23, 19],\r\n      type: 'line',\r\n      areaStyle: {}\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      data: [25, 14, 23, 35, 10],\r\n      type: 'line',\r\n      areaStyle: {\r\n        color: '#ff0',\r\n        opacity: 0.5\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to change the area style of the line chart, try to use [`areaStyle`](${optionPath}series-line.areaStyle). Set `'areaStyle'` to `{}` to use the default type: use the color of series to fill the area in translucent. If you want to change the style, try to override the configuration items in `'areaStyle'`. For example, the color of the second series was changed to yellow with 50% opacity.\r\n"}}]);
