One axis shows the name of categories being compared, while the other axis represents the scale value. As an example, Using a bi-directional bar chart to analyze the personal income (positive number) and outcome (negative number) in a week, you can easily find the value and fluctuation of income and outcome in a single series.\r\n\r\n<iframe max-width="830" width="100%" height="400"\r\nsrc="https://gallery.echartsjs.com/view-lite.html?cid=xS18jqmX4f">\r\n</iframe>\r\n\r\nThe bi-directional bar can be classified into the vertical chart (above) and horizontal chart(below, also called positive negative bar chart). For example, you can use a positive negative bar chart if there are positive and negative comments in a customer satisfaction survey data analysis. All data align in the middle, the positive comments attribute on the right side while the negative comments on the left side.\r\n\r\n<iframe max-width="830" width="100%" height="400"\r\n src="https://gallery.echartsjs.com/view-lite.html?cid=xHJ1un374z">\r\n</iframe>\r\n\r\n## Suggestion for Using Bi-directional Bar Chart\r\n\r\n1. The data on both sides in the bi-directional bar chart are comparative.\r\n\r\n2. Don\'t define negative data on the right side of the bi-directional bar chart, to prevent misunderstanding caused by the violation of common sense.\r\n\r\n<img max-width="830" width="100%" height="100%"\r\nsrc="images/design/bar/bi-directional-bar01.jpg">\r\n</img>\r\n\r\n3. A bi-directional bar chart always used to display data with the opposite meaning, so that you need to avoid misunderstanding caused by the use of data that does not have a positive or negative meaning. As the chart below, there is no antagonism between the data of male and female, so that it is a better choice to use a basic bar chart rather than a bi-directional bar chart.\r\n\r\n<img max-width="830" width="100%" height="100%"\r\nsrc="images/design/bar/bi-directional-bar02.jpg">\r\n</img>\r\n'}}]);
