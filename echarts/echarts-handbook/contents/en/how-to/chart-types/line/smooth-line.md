# Smooth Line Chart

The smooth line chart is also a variant of the basic line graph. It is a better choice for you to perform a comfort visual experience. While using the ECharts, you only need to change the `smooth` to `true` to achieve this effect.

```js live
option = {
  xAxis: {
    data: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
  },
  yAxis: {},
  series: [
    {
      data: [10, 22, 28, 23, 19],
      type: 'line',
      smooth: true
    }
  ]
};
```
