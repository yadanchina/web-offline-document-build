# Basic Line Chart

## Simple Example

We can use the following code to build a line chart which has x-axis as `category`, y-axis as `value`:

```js live
option = {
  xAxis: {
    type: 'category',
    data: ['A', 'B', 'C']
  },
  yAxis: {
    type: 'value'
  },
  series: [
    {
      data: [120, 200, 150],
      type: 'line'
    }
  ]
};
```

In this case, we set the type of axis to `category` and `value` under `xAxis` and `yAxis`. We also clarified the content on the x-axis through `data`. In `series`, we set the type to `line`, and specify the values of three points through `data`. In this way, we got a simple line chart.

> The `type` here can be omitted because the defaults of the axis are `value` while `xAxis` has specified the category's `data`. In this case, `ECharts` can recognize that this is a category axis.

## Line Chart in Cartesian Coordinate System

How to implement if we want the line chart to be continuous? The answer is simple, as long as every value in `data` of the `series` is represented by an array containing two elements.

```js live
option = {
  xAxis: {},
  yAxis: {},
  series: [
    {
      data: [
        [20, 120],
        [50, 200],
        [40, 50]
      ],
      type: 'line'
    }
  ]
};
```

## Customized Line Chart

### Line Style

Line style can be changed by `lineStyle` setting. You can specify color, line width, polyline type and opacity etc.. For details, please see the handbook [`series.lineStyle`](${optionPath}series-line.lineStyle) to figure out.

Here is an example of setting color, line width and type.

```js live
option = {
  xAxis: {
    data: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
  },
  yAxis: {},
  series: [
    {
      data: [10, 22, 28, 23, 19],
      type: 'line',
      lineStyle: {
        normal: {
          color: 'green',
          width: 4,
          type: 'dashed'
        }
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

When we set the line width here, the line width of items will not change. The line style of items needs to be set separately.

### Item Style

Item style can be change by [`series.itemStyle`](${optionPath}series-line.itemStyle). It included `color`, `borderColor`, `borderStyle`, `borderWidth`, `borderType`, `shadowColor`, `opacity` and so on. It works the same as the `lineType`, so we will not do further discuss.

## Display Value on Items.

In the series, the label of the item was specified by [`series.label`](${optionPath}series-line.label). If we change the `show` under `label` to `true`, the value will be displayed by default. Otherwise, if [`series.emphasis.label.show`](${optionPath}series-line.emphasis.label.show) is `true`, the label will show only if the mouse moved across the item.

```js live
option = {
  xAxis: {
    data: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
  },
  yAxis: {},
  series: [
    {
      data: [10, 22, 28, 23, 19],
      type: 'line',
      label: {
        show: true,
        position: 'bottom',
        textStyle: {
          fontSize: 20
        }
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

## Empty Data

In a `series`, there are empty data. It has some difference with `0`. While there are empty elements, the lines chart will ignore that point without pass through it----empty elements will not be connected by the points next by.

In ECharts, we use `'-'` to represent null data, It is applicable for data in other series.

```js live
option = {
  xAxis: {
    data: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
  },
  yAxis: {},
  series: [
    {
      data: [0, 22, '-', 23, 19],
      type: 'line'
    }
  ]
};
```

> Please note the difference between the empty data and 0.
