# Basic Scatter Chart

Scatter Chart, a frequently used chart type, was constructed with several "points". These points sometimes represent the position of the value in the coordinate system (cartesian coordinate system, geo coordinate system, etc.), sometimes the size and color of items can be mapped to the value, represent high-dimensional data.

## Simple Example

The following example is a basic scatter chart configuration with the x-axis as category and the y-axis as value:

```js live
option = {
  xAxis: {
    data: ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat']
  },
  yAxis: {},
  series: [
    {
      type: 'scatter',
      data: [220, 182, 191, 234, 290, 330, 310]
    }
  ]
};
```

## Scatter Chart in Cartesian Coordinate System

In the previous case, the x-axis of the scatter chart is a discrete category axis and the y-axis is a continuous value axis. However, the normal scene for the scatter chart is to have 2 continuous value axis (also called the cartesian coordinate system). The series type is different in that both x-axis and y-axis value are included in `data`, but not in `xAxis` and `yAxis`.

```js live
option = {
  xAxis: {},
  yAxis: {},
  series: [
    {
      type: 'scatter',
      data: [
        [10, 5],
        [0, 8],
        [6, 10],
        [2, 12],
        [8, 9]
      ]
    }
  ]
};
```

## Customized Scatter Chart

### Symbol Style

Symbol refers to the item shape in a scatter chart. There are three types of config available. The first is ECharts built-in shape, the second is image, the last is the SVG path.

The built-in shape in ECharts included: `'circle'`, `'rect'`(rectangle), `'roundRect'`(rounded rectangle), `'triangle'`, `'diamond'`, `'pin'` and `'arrow'`. To use built-in shapes, you need to state the `symbol` to the corresponding string.

If you want to define the shape as any image, try to use `'image'` following by the path, eg. `'image://http://example.com/xxx.png'` or `'image://./xxx.png'`.

ECharts `symbol` also supports SVG vector graphics. You can define `symbol` as an SVG file path that starts with `'path://'` to locate the vector graphics. The advantages of vector graphics are smaller size and no jagged or blurred.

Method to find the SVG path: Open an `SVG` path; Find the path similar as `<path d="M… L…"></path>`; Add `d`'s value after `'path://'`. Let's check how to define an item to vector shape of heart.

Firstly, we need an `SVG` file of a heart. You can draw one by vector editing software, or download one from the internet. Here is the content:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 51.997 51.997" style="enable-background:new 0 0 51.997 51.997;" xml:space="preserve">
    <path d="M51.911,16.242C51.152,7.888,45.239,1.827,37.839,1.827c-4.93,0-9.444,2.653-11.984,6.905 c-2.517-4.307-6.846-6.906-11.697-6.906c-7.399,0-13.313,6.061-14.071,14.415c-0.06,0.369-0.306,2.311,0.442,5.478 c1.078,4.568,3.568,8.723,7.199,12.013l18.115,16.439l18.426-16.438c3.631-3.291,6.121-7.445,7.199-12.014 C52.216,18.553,51.97,16.611,51.911,16.242z"/>
</svg>
```

In ECharts, define config `symbol` as a path of d:

```js live
option = {
  xAxis: {
    data: ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat']
  },
  yAxis: {},
  series: [
    {
      type: 'scatter',
      data: [220, 182, 191, 234, 290, 330, 310],
      symbolSize: 20,
      symbol:
        'path://M51.911,16.242C51.152,7.888,45.239,1.827,37.839,1.827c-4.93,0-9.444,2.653-11.984,6.905 c-2.517-4.307-6.846-6.906-11.697-6.906c-7.399,0-13.313,6.061-14.071,14.415c-0.06,0.369-0.306,2.311,0.442,5.478 c1.078,4.568,3.568,8.723,7.199,12.013l18.115,16.439l18.426-16.438c3.631-3.291,6.121-7.445,7.199-12.014 C52.216,18.553,51.97,16.611,51.911,16.242z'
    }
  ]
};
```

In this way, we have a heart vector of the item.

### Symbol Size

The size of symbol is defined by [`series.symbolSize`](${optionPath}series-scatter.symbolSize). It can be s pixel value of the item size, or an array included two numbers, to define the width and height.

Besides, it can be defined as a call back function. Here is an example of the format:

```ts
(value: Array | number, params: Object) => number | Array;
```

The first argument is the data value, and the second argument included other arguments of the data item. In the following instance, we define the size of the item proportional related to the data value.

```js live
option = {
  xAxis: {
    data: ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat']
  },
  yAxis: {},
  series: [
    {
      type: 'scatter',
      data: [220, 182, 191, 234, 290, 330, 310],
      symbolSize: function(value) {
        return value / 10;
      }
    }
  ]
};
```
